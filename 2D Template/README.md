# 2D Template

Built off [template-p5-project](https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253/tree/master/templates/template-p5-project) provided by [Pippin Barr](https://github.com/pippinbarr). which allows the use of the [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) library.

It's a basic template for 2D projects. It was made by stripping P1 to its essentials.

The user can control a player object using the W, A, S and D keys.
The player object can be teleported to the mouse's position using the SPACE key or any mouse button.
