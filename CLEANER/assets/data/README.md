# Data folder

This folder contains all JSON data used in the project.


For [tags.json](tags.json), the data is divided into 2 categories:

##### Abstract
Contains tags that are very open-ended, which leads to a great variety of images.
However, it would be unfair for a user to try and identify 'dread' in a picture, so they cannot be used as tags to censor.

##### Concrete
Contains tags that refer to concrete, single-interpretation objects. 
These are tags that the user will be asked to censor.
