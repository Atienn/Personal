# Gravitation Engine

This application simulates gravitational interactions between massive bodies using Newton's law of universal gravitation.
Its goal is to let its users develop a general understanding of how massive bodies interact with one anothers in space.

The simulator originally started out as a school project for an astronomy class in late 2019.
Over the summer of 2020, it was further developped for public use as a passion project.

As of its making, I still hadn't learned all fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (namely classes), 
which is why some of the code ends up being redundant and unoptimized.


Developped by Ã‰tienne Racine.
