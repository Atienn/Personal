# Gravitation Engine

This application simulates gravitational interactions between massive bodies using Newton's law of universal gravitation.
Its goal is to let its users develop a general understanding of how massive bodies interact with one anothers in space.

The simulator originally started out as a school project for an astronomy class in late 2019.
Over the summer of 2020, it was further developped for public use as a passion project.

If you'd like to try it for yourself, [Builds](https://github.com/Atienn/Personal-Projects/tree/main/Gravitation%20Engine/Builds) holds all published versions of the project. If you want to look at its code, [Assets/Scripts](https://github.com/Atienn/Personal-Projects/tree/main/Gravitation%20Engine/Assets/Scripts) holds all the behaviour scripts used.


Developped by Ã‰tienne Racine.
